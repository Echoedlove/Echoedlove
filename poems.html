            <h3>Drowning for You</h3>
            <p>
                My thoughts of you are endless,<br>
                A storm that never calms.<br>
                I drown in the beauty of your smile,<br>
                And the peace of your calm.<br><br>
                I reach for you in the midnight sky,<br>
                As dreams pull me under.<br>
                Drowning for you in every heartbeat,<br>
                You are my thunder.<br><br>
                For every word you never spoke,<br>
                I loved you even more.<br>
                Lost in your eyes, the silent love,<br>
                Is the only thing I adore.

            <h3>Craving His Existence</h3>
            <p>
                I crave his existence like,<br>
                Love craves trust,<br>
                Sky craves stars in the darkness,<br>
                Sea craves shore that holds it close.<br><br>
                I crave his existence like,<br>
                Lovers crave their endless dove.

            <h3>Falling Through Silence</h3>
            <p>
                In the silence, I fall,<br>
                Tumbling without sound,<br>
                The world spins around me,<br>
                But I am lost, unbound.<br><br>
                I search for your presence,<br>
                In the air, in the sky,<br>
                But you're nowhere to be found,<br>
                Just the echo of my sigh.

            <h3>Unwritten Letters</h3>
            <p>
                I wrote you letters without ink,<br>
                On pages that never turned,<br>
                Each word carved in silence,<br>
                Yet the yearning still burned.<br><br>
                The paper never met the pen,<br>
                But in my heart, you’ll always stay,<br>
                Unwritten, unspoken, yet forever true,<br>
                In a world of words, just for you.

                I dream of stardust falling,<br>
                Of skies that never end,<br>
                Of endless love, that whispers<br>
                In the arms of the stars, my friend.<br><br>
                You are the dream I chase at night,<br>
                The star that guides my way,<br>
                In every dream, in every breath,<br>
                You are the light that stays.

                In the silence, there’s a song,<br>
                Unheard, but felt inside,<br>
                A melody so sweet and soft,<br>
                That I can’t help but hide.<br><br>
                It plays within my heart each day,<br>
                And every note is you,<br>
                A symphony of love so pure,<br>

                I am pulled toward you evermore.<br>
                With every rush of water’s might,<br>
                I am lost in your endless light.<br><br>
                Though I may drown in your deep embrace,<br>
                I’ll never let go of your grace.

                Time stands still when I’m with you,<br>
                Every second feels like years,<br>
                We are timeless in our love,<br>
                Erasing all doubts and fears.<br><br>

                You whispered goodbye so softly,<br>
                Like a breeze that touched my soul,<br>
                Yet your absence left a hole,<br>
                A space that swallows me whole.<br><br>
                But in that goodbye, I found my truth,<br>
