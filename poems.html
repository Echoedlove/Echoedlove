            <h3>If only i knew</h3>
            <p>
               If only I knew, I'd yearn for those days,<br>
               Childhood's magic, in wonder-filled ways.<br>
               First glimpses of worlds, both far and wide,<br>
               Left me breathless, with a curious stride.<br><br>
               
                But now, in hindsight, I realize with a sigh,<br>
                If only I knew, I'd have cherished those times to the sky.<br>
                For in innocence, I roamed wild and free,<br>
                Unaware of life's complexities, yet to be.<br><br>
                
                Those carefree days, like falling leaves, slipped away,<br>
                Leaving memories, bittersweet, night and day.<br>
                If only I knew, I'd have held on tight,<br>
                To the enchantment of childhood's pure delight.

            <h3>Symphony of Love</h3>
            <p>
               Oh love! Loving you was like<br>
                the ocean reaching for the shore,<br>
                the blooming of blossom trees,<br>
                warmth on a hibernal day.<br><br>
                
                Softly falling summer rain,<br>
                Gentle whispers in the night,<br>
                A haven from life's raging storms,<br>
                A guiding star that shone so bright.<br><br>

                Your love was a symphony,<br>
                That echoed through my soul,<br>
                A melody that made me whole,<br>
                Forever and always, my heart's goal.

            <h3>The Paradox of Hope</h3>
            <p>
               In secret depths, I hide and ache<br>
               Yearning to escape, to break the chain<br>
               A glimmer of hope, a sunbeam bright<br>
               Lures me with warmth, and radiant light<br><br>
                
               But alas, the fire that I pursue<br>
               Becomes the flame that my soul subdues<br>
               A paradox of hope and despair<br>
               A heart trapped in shadows, beyond repair.

            <h3>A Love Unspoken</h3>
            <p>
                He was never mine, I knew from the start<br>
                Yet I took his heart, and played with the art<br>
                Now I hold him tight, with a love so true<br>
                But the thought of losing him, haunts me anew<br>

                One day I'll let him go, and it will be my fate<br>
                The worst part of my life, an unbearable weight<br>
                I'll cherish every moment, every kiss and every sigh<br>
                For when he's gone, I'll be left to wonder why<br>
                
                But till then, I'll love him with all my might<br>
                And hold on to the memories, of our love so bright<br>
                Though it may not last, I'll make it forever true<br>
                For loving him, is all I can do."<br>

                We never know when our last day arrives<br>
                So let's fill each moment with love and laughter<br>

                And make each day a gift, to ourselves and those we love to fly<br>
                Simple moments, pure joy, that's all we need<br>
                To make life's journey, a beautiful dream"

            <h3>A World of Our Own</h3>
            <p>
                In nature’s arms, where love once bloomed,<br>
                I wander free, no longer doomed.<br>
                The skies above, the earth below,<br>
                Whisper your name, where soft winds blow.<br><br>

                Though you’re not here, you still remain,<br>
                In every leaf, in every rain.<br>
                The world around me, so pure and wide,<br>
                Reflects the love I feel inside.<br><br>

                I live in dreams, a fairytale spun,<br>
                Where our love story’s never undone.<br>
                No worries, no fears, just endless light,<br>
                In our world, everything feels right.<br><br>

                You walk a path where others tread,<br>
                But in my heart, you’re still ahead.<br>
                Let them speak, let them say their words,<br>
                For only ours are what’s truly heard.<br><br>

                In a world where change is always near,<br>
                Where hearts may fade, and people disappear,<br>
                I’ll stand by you, unwavering, true—<br>
                A love so strong, it breaks through.<br><br>

                Let’s build a world where we both belong,<br>
                Where no one’s words can feel too strong.<br>
                A place where time is never cruel,<br>
                Where love, like ours, makes its own rule.<br><br>

                So, let them change, let them grow,<br>
                In our world, we’ll always know:<br>
                I’m yours, you’re mine, no matter the cost,<br>
                In a love where nothing’s ever lost.

                A masterpiece in celestial sands.<br>
                So many forces, unseen, untold,<br>
                Guiding us through the stories of old.<br><br>

                You and I, a moment so rare,<br>
                A meeting meant to be, beyond compare.<br>
                Who are we to question this plan,<br>
                When stars themselves decreed our span?<br><br>

                For in this life, as worlds collide,<br>
                We stand as one, side by side.<br>
                No force, no hand, no voice can sever,<br>
                What fate has bound, what love will treasure forever.

              Oh, fate, my guide, my heart, my soul,<br>
                Take my being, make me whole.<br>
                I’ll offer all, without a trace,<br>
                If only you’d grant me his embrace.<br><br>

                Take my body, take my mind,<br>
                Let me leave the world behind.<br>
                But give me back the love I crave,<br>
                His essence, his heart, forever to save.<br><br>

                I'll walk through flames, endure the night,<br>
                Cross shattered glass, with no respite.<br>
                Each step a sacrifice, each breath a plea,<br>
                All for the chance to have him with me.<br><br>

                If his old self could be returned,<br>
                With every lesson, every year learned,<br>
                I’d lay it all down, no fear, no strife,<br>
                To breathe again in the warmth of his life.<br><br>

                Let me be the one who bears the cost,<br>
                For in his love, I find no loss.<br>
                I’ll sacrifice the world to make him see,<br>

            <h3>A Dream of Home</h3>
            <p>
              When I was young, I dreamt of more,<br>
              Of careers and titles to adore.<br>
              But now as time begins to sway,<br>
              My heart desires a different way.<br><br>

              A home, a haven, soft and bright,<br>
              Where love blooms gently in the light.<br>
              No chaos, no loud voices near,<br>
              Just peaceful days, with hearts sincere.<br><br>

              I dream of moments, calm and true,<br>
              Where laughter echoes, soft as dew.<br>
              Of cooking meals with gentle hands,<br>
              And grocery trips with simple plans.<br><br>

              A family, loving, kind, and strong,<br>
              Where no one’s right, and no one’s wrong.<br>
              Where peace is found in every part,<br>
              And every day feels like a start.<br><br>

              So I wish for this, my quiet plea,<br>
              A home where love is all I see<br>
              No grand success, no shining fame<br>
              Just hearts entwined, forever the same.

            <h3>A Reflection of Change</h3>
            <p>
                Once a child, so pure, so free,<br>
                Dancing through life, no cares to see.<br>
                The sweetest smile, the brightest glow,<br> 
                A heart unscarred, with love to show.<br><br>

                She didn’t know what the future held,<br>
                The storms, the doubts, where they’d be felled.<br>
                The world so vast, yet she stood tall,<br>
                Unaware of the shadows that would come to call.<br><br>

                With innocence, she loved so deep,<br>
                Expecting the world would love her to keep.<br>
                But life’s not sugar, it’s not always kind,<br>

                Insecurities crept, doubts took their place,<br>
                A quiet reflection, a longing for grace.<br>
                She compared, she questioned, what went wrong,<br>
                When all she wanted was to belong.<br><br>

                But the world, she’ll learn, is not a fair game,<br>
                It takes more than love to rise to fame.<br>
                She’ll grow, she’ll fall, and she’ll rise again,<br>
                For strength comes through the deepest pain.<br><br>

                So, little one, don’t mourn the change,<br>
                For in the end, it’s all in range.<br>
                The sweetest girl, the brightest light,<br>
                Can still shine through the darkest night.

            <h3>Afraid of Losing You</h3>
            <p>
                You are mine, and I am yours,<br>
                A love so pure, it forever endures.<br>
                In seeking you, I lost my way,<br>
                Yet found a love that will always stay.<br><br>

                But in the quiet of my heart,<br>
                A fear resides, a tear apart.<br>
                What if this world, so harsh, so cold,<br>
                Finds ways to sever what we hold?<br><br>

                You are the one I can't bear to lose,<br>
                The light in my life, the warmth I choose.<br>
                And yet, the world with all its might,<br>
                Could steal you from me in the dead of night.<br><br>

                What if they try, with cruel hands,<br>
                To tear apart our distant lands?<br>
                My soul shivers at the thought alone,<br>
                For in your love, I've found my home.<br><br>
                
                But still, my love, we’ll stand as one,<br>
                With hearts united, till time is done.<br>
                No force, no world, no raging tide,<br>
                Can ever break what we’ve inside.
